Sure, here are some examples to illustrate the differences between var, let, and const:

Example 1: Scope

function exampleVar() {
    var x = 1;
    if (true) {
        var x = 2;  // same variable!
        console.log(x);  // 2
    }
    console.log(x);  // 2
}

function exampleLet() {
    let x = 1;
    if (true) {
        let x = 2;  // different variable
        console.log(x);  // 2
    }
    console.log(x);  // 1
}

exampleVar();
exampleLet();
Copy
Example 2: Re-declaration and Updating

var x = 1;
var x = 2; // This is fine

let y = 1;
let y = 2; // This will throw an error

const z = 1;
const z = 2; // This will throw an error
Copy
Example 3: Hoisting

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 3;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
let b = 3;

console.log(c); // ReferenceError: c is not defined
const c = 3;
Copy
In the first example, you can see how var is function-scoped and let is block-scoped. In the second example, you can see how var allows re-declaration, let allows updating but not re-declaration, and const doesn’t allow either. In the third example, you can see how all three are hoisted, but var is initialized with undefined, while let and const are not initialized.

The const keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables that are not supposed to be re-assigned. Once a const variable has been assigned, trying to reassign it will throw an error. Here’s an example:

const pi = 3.14;
pi = 1; // This will throw an error
Copy
In the above code, trying to reassign the pi variable will result in an error because pi was declared with const.

However, it’s important to note that const does not make the variable itself immutable, just the assignment. If the const variable is an object or array, the properties or elements can still be modified:

const obj = { property: "Hello" };
obj.property = "World"; // This is fine

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[0] = 0; // This is fine
Copy
In the above code, even though obj and arr are declared with const, their properties and elements can still be modified. The const keyword only prevents reassignment of the variable itself.
